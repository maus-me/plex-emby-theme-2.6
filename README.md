#plex-emby-theme-2.6
Improvements upon the one created by fillidill.

## Features over fillidill version
* Hidden category text commas on library items
* Replaced theme colors with mint green, an adjacent color to Plex's Orange.
* Fixed background images and background videos to cover entire background (no more black bars).
* Added pop-out effect on hover of library items
* Posters that are not properly 
* Removed the Back button from the home screen
* Revamped the sidebar.  Much more responsive and usable.
* Removed the Play Icon on item hover.
* Gave icons hover effects.
* Replaced default "Plex" color with a new modern "Mint" color.



## Known Issues:
* Mobile browser streaming causes videos to use "background: cover" instead of "background: fill"
* Borders on hover does not respect the "blow-up" effect causing 1-2px image bleed through border.
* Text colors in Settings not set.  If user is set to "light" themes may cause black text on settings.



## Tested on:
* Chrome
* Firefox
